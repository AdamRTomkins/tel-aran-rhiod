## About

Tel'aran'rhiod is literary creation of Robert Jordan, author of the exceptional Wheel of Time fantasy series. Tel'aran'rhiod, or the World of Dreams is described as a world that is both of the world and apart from it, possibly lying between the weaves of the Great Pattern. Most people cannot enter it deliberately, though many touch it briefly, for just a few moments.
